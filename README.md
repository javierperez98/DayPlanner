## Day Planner

## Description
- In this project I created A day Planner that updates with the colors to match the current time.
- It lets you type out, add events and save them to local storage.
- It has a live clock of the current day, month, year and time.
- This project was challenging in all aspects of JavaScript and Jquery.
- The biggest issue I came across was Jquery but I was able to tackle it with a little help from google, docs and classmates.
